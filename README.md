###  13033 App

I developed this mobile app called 13033 using Google's Flutter (in less than 6 hours) for simplyfying the process of registering your movement (by sending the required SMS to 13033) when leaving your house during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece. The app can be found on [**Play Store**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=metakinisi.app).

The app was also featured in an [article](https://www.thetoc.gr/koinwnia/article/koronoios-13033---i-dorean-efarmogi-pou-stelnei-ta-sms-metakinisis-me-3-klik/) on a greek news site and providing some publicity. Now, after less than a month, it has reached more than 6.5K downloads and helped many people in their daily life.

### How does it work?
 - The user first has to fill in her name and adress which is stored locally on the device. No personal data leaves the phone and the app is GDPR compliant. 
 - On the next screen, the user selects the option for your movement. Once the selection is made, the messaging application gets launced with prefilled the generated message. 
 - The design is simple on purpose; large buttons and clear layout to avoid any possible confusions or misinterpretations.
 - The option of automatically sending the SMS without entering the SMS app was rejected because of the additional permissions that the app would have needed and often scare people.
